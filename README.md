## Overview

`pswitch` is a lightweight local proxy for routing AI client traffic across multiple upstream providers.

It is designed for setups where you want:

- one stable local endpoint such as `/codex`
- multiple upstream providers behind it
- automatic failover and recovery
- a clean dashboard for traffic, token usage, provider health, and runtime config

By default, `pswitch` starts with a single OpenAI-compatible route on `/codex`. You can add more routes and providers later from the dashboard.

## Features

- Multiple upstream providers with automatic failover
- Circuit breaking and periodic health recovery probes
- Three routing modes:
  - `round_robin`
  - `sequential`
  - `least_failures`
- OpenAI-compatible routing out of the box
- Optional Anthropic-compatible route adapter
- Persistent dashboard metrics for:
  - requests
  - input / output / total tokens
  - provider failures
  - per-model usage
- Embedded admin dashboard at `/dashboard/`
- Runtime config editing with hot reload where possible
- `settings.json` and `metrics.json` persisted in the current working directory
- Optional admin token protection with `PSWITCH_ADMIN_TOKEN`

## Quick Start

### Download a release

Open [Releases](https://github.com/wlynxg/pswitch/releases/latest) and download the archive that matches your platform:

- Linux x86_64: `pswitch_vX.Y.Z_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- Linux ARM64: `pswitch_vX.Y.Z_linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- macOS Intel: `pswitch_vX.Y.Z_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`
- macOS Apple Silicon: `pswitch_vX.Y.Z_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
- Windows x86_64: `pswitch_vX.Y.Z_windows_amd64.zip`

Extract the archive, then run `pswitch` from the extracted directory.

### Start the service

No config file is required for the first launch.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
./pswitch
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\pswitch.exe
```

By default, `pswitch` listens on `0.0.0.0:8080`, exposes `/codex`, and starts with the built-in config.

### Open the dashboard

On the same machine:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard/
```

From another device on the same network or on a server:

```text
http://<server-ip>:8080/dashboard/
```

Use the `Config` page to add providers and save runtime settings. `settings.json` and `metrics.json` are written to the directory where you run the binary.

### Run with Docker

Build and start with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Or build and run the image directly:

```bash
docker build -t pswitch .
docker run -d \
  --name pswitch \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  -e PSWITCH_ADMIN_TOKEN=your-token \
  pswitch
```

Or pull the published image from GHCR:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/wlynxg/pswitch:latest
docker run -d \
  --name pswitch \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  ghcr.io/wlynxg/pswitch:latest
```

Docker notes:

- the container listens on `0.0.0.0:8080`
- runtime files are stored in `/data`
- mount `./data:/data` to persist `settings.json` and `metrics.json`
- if `/data/settings.json` does not exist yet, `pswitch` starts with the built-in default config

### Point your client at pswitch

Use the local proxy endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/codex
```

Example Codex-style config:

```toml
[model_providers.OpenAI]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/codex"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = true
```

### Build from source

```bash
make build
```

Binary output:

```bash
./bin/pswitch
```

### Run from source build

```bash
./bin/pswitch
```

Or:

```bash
./bin/pswitch --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Default Behavior

If no saved runtime config exists, `pswitch` starts with the built-in default config.

Default startup behavior:

- listen on `0.0.0.0:8080`
- use `round_robin` mode
- expose one route: `/codex`
- start with no preconfigured providers

Default file behavior:

- dashboard-saved runtime config goes to `./settings.json`
- dashboard metrics go to `./metrics.json`
- if `settings.json` exists, it takes precedence on startup

## Anthropic-style client

If you manually add an Anthropic route, you can point a Claude-style client to it:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy
```

## Config Example

```toml
# Listen address for the local proxy and dashboard.
listen = "0.0.0.0:8080"

# Provider selection strategy:
# - round_robin: rotate across healthy providers
# - sequential: always try providers in list order
# - least_failures: prefer healthy providers with fewer recent failures
mode = "least_failures"

# Circuit-break a provider after this many consecutive upstream failures.
failure_threshold = 1

# Wait this long before probing a failed provider again.
cooldown = "20s"

# How often the background health loop checks whether a provider should be probed.
health_check_interval = "15s"

# Timeout for each health probe request.
health_check_timeout = "3s"

[[routes]]
# Public route prefix exposed by pswitch.
prefix = "/codex"

# Protocol adapter used by this route.
type = "openai"

[[routes]]
# Optional route for Anthropic-compatible clients.
prefix = "/claude"
type = "anthropic"

# Model name advertised back to Anthropic-style clients.
model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

# Actual upstream model sent to your provider.
upstream_model = "gpt-5.4"

[[providers]]
# Unique provider name used in the dashboard and route filters.
name = "provider-a"

# Base URL of the upstream API. Most providers expect the /v1 suffix here.
base_url = "https://provider-a.example/v1"

# Secret key forwarded to the upstream provider.
api_key = "sk-your-provider-a-key"

[[providers]]
# Add more providers to enable failover and traffic spreading.
name = "provider-b"
base_url = "https://provider-b.example/v1"
api_key = "sk-your-provider-b-key"
```

Use this example as a field reference when editing runtime config in the dashboard. `pswitch` does not load this TOML file on startup.

## Admin Dashboard

The embedded dashboard is available at:

```text
/dashboard/
```

It provides:

- overview metrics
- 24h / 7d token windows
- provider analytics
- provider health cards
- per-model usage panels
- runtime config editing
- English / Chinese language switch

If `PSWITCH_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set, both the dashboard UI and admin API require it.

## CLI

Run directly:

```bash
pswitch [--listen ADDR] [--mode sequential|round_robin|least_failures] [--failure-threshold N] [--cooldown DURATION] [--health-check-interval DURATION] [--health-check-timeout DURATION] [--log-color[=true|false]]
```

## Troubleshooting

- `init` writes to `config.toml` in the binary directory by default
- Dashboard-edited runtime config is written to `settings.json` in the current working directory
- Usage and provider stats are written to `metrics.json` in the current working directory
- `api_key` must be non-empty for each provider
- If one provider fails, `pswitch` will try the next one
- Health probes only log when a provider recovers
- If usage is missing in logs, the upstream response did not include token usage
- If `/claude` is enabled, make sure its route has `upstream_model`

## Makefile

- `make build` builds `./bin/pswitch`
- `make run` starts the service
- `make test` runs the test suite
- `make clean` removes build artifacts

## Release Automation

GitHub Releases are built automatically when you push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The release workflow builds archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows, uploads them with a `checksums.txt` file, and publishes a multi-arch Docker image to `ghcr.io/wlynxg/pswitch`.
